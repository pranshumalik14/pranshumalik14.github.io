                <p>
                    I am a PhD student at the
                    <a href="https://www.oist.jp/">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</a>, currently
                    undertaking rotations in research units supervised by
                    <a href="https://www.oist.jp/research/research-units/cnru">Jun Tani</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.oist.jp/research/research-units/ncu">Kenji Doya</a>, and
                    <a href="https://www.oist.jp/research/research-units/ecsu">Tom Froese</a>.
                    Previously, I did a master's (by research) in neuroscience at
                    <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/">Western University</a> in the
                    <a href="https://superlab.ca/about.html">Sensorimotor Superlab</a>. Before that I was an
                    undergrad at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> where I studied
                    electrical engineering with a focus on control systems and robotics.

                    My primary research interests lie at the confluence of robotics and neuroscience.
                    A fundamental question that drives me is about the computation and representation of
                    actions and their perception, and how we can reliably or at least plausibly bring our understanding
                    and artificial formulation of control closer to <em>reality</em> &mdash; to not only enable more
                    robust and easily generalizable robotic control but also gain further and integrative understanding
                    of biological sensorimotor control. Some directions that I am currently exploring include:

                            Through careful experiments and analyses, minimal temporal separation between feedback and
                            voluntary control was observed, highlighting their tight coupling. Interestingly, both
                            short- and long-latency reflex responses were found to begin updating nearly as quickly as
                            visuomotor response times. Additional nuanced observations indicate a resource- and
                            time-efficient strategy employed in the computation of corrective feedback responses.
